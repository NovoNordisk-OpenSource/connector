\title{Write Objects to Files Using S7 Method Dispatch}
\usage{
write_ext(x, file, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{The object to write to the file. Can be any R object.}

\item{file}{A character string specifying the file path. The file extension
will be used for method dispatch.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed to the underlying write function.
These arguments are specific to the data format being written and may include
parameters such as file encoding, compression options, or format-specific settings.}
}
\value{
The file path (invisibly), or whatever the specific method returns.
}
\description{
\code{write_ext} is an S7 generic function that supports double dispatch for writing objects.
It allows you to define methods based on both the type of the object being written.
}
\details{
This generic is designed to support the connector package's workflow for writing files, but
also to allow for extensibility through S7 method dispatch based on file extensions.
This makes it possible for users to create custom methods for saving different types of objects.

When writing files through a connector, the file extension
is automatically detected and added as a class to the file path. This enables
double dispatch based on both the object type (\code{x}) and the file extension (\code{file}),
allowing you to define specialized save methods for different combinations.
\subsection{Method Dispatch}{

The generic dispatches on two arguments:
\itemize{
\item \code{x}: The object to be written (e.g., data.frame, list, S7 object)
\item \code{file}: The file path with the file extension as its class
}

This allows you to create methods like:
\itemize{
\item \code{write_ext(data.frame, "csv")} - for saving data frames to CSV
\item \code{write_ext(list, "json")} - for saving lists to JSON
\item \code{write_ext(S7_object, "rds")} - for saving S7 objects to RDS
}
}
}
