# connector <a href="https://fantastic-adventure-gqozn9k.pages.github.io/"><img src="man/figures/logo.png" align="right" height="138" alt="connector website" /></a>

Connector provides a consistent interface for connecting to different data sources, 
such as as simple file storage systems and databases.

It also gives the option to use a central configuration file to manage your connections in your project,
which ensures a consistent reference to the same data source across different scripts in your project,
and enables you to easily switch between different data sources.

```{r}
library(connector)
```

```{yml, file = system.file("config/readme.yml", package = "connector"), eval = FALSE}
```

```{r}
config <- system.file("config/readme.yml", package = "connector")

db <- connect(config)

print(db)
```

```{r}

db$database
```

```{r}

cars <- mtcars |> tibble::as_tibble(rownames = "car")

  write_cnt(x = cars, name = "cars.parquet")
